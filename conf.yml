# Configuration options
#
# You can override anything you see in the "conf:" tree in box/box.yml here!
# Additionally, there are a few properties you can set here that do not have
# defaults in box.yml that you may find useful.
#
# NTP
# It is assumed openntpd-in-a-box is running on the same IP as dnsmasq-in-a-box, but
# if not, you can uncomment this to use 0.pool.ntp.org
# ntp_server: 0.pool.ntp.org
#
# APK REPOS
# Uncomment to use your favorite APK mirror
# Only add the URL pointing the mirror root, everything else is added automatically!
# For example, if you set the following:
#alpine_mirror: http://192.168.1.2/alpine
# it will resolve to:
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/v3.3/{main,community}
# -AND-
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/edge/{main,community,testing}
#
# DNS SEARCH DOMAINS
# Add search domains. Keep the leading comma or you'll get a parse error from dnsmasq. Sorry.
# conf: domain: is included here, and is set to "local" by default or whatever you override it as
# in this conf.yml file.
# dns_search: ",emc.com"
#
# FORWARD SERVER
# If you don't also have unbound-in-a-box running on the same host, you'll probably want to
# uncomment and set the relevant lines below for your environment.
# For example, if you want to reset to the default behavior of reading upstream DNS servers
# from /etc/resolv.conf, uncomment all three lines.  If you want to specify a different
# upstream DNS server than localhost, then uncomment the forward_to line, remove the '#', and
# set the IP and port to match your upstream server.
#no_resolv: "#no-resolv"
#no_poll: "#no-poll"
#forward_to: "#server=127.0.0.1#5353"
#
# DHCP
#dhcp_enabled: true
#dhcp_range_start: 192.168.1.100
#dhcp_range_end: 192.168.1.199
#dhcp_range_netmask: 255.255.255.0
#dhcp_lease_time: 12h
#default_gateway: 192.168.1.1
